# TSC Language Server

A language server made for the TSC scripting format used in games such as Cave
Story. It aims to be small, performant, and completely editor-agnostic. The
language server implements the [`.tscrc.json` spec][tscrc-spec].

## Project Overview

The language server is written in the Go programming language and ships as a
standalone binary. Language clients can connect to the server through TCP or
stdio.

Please note that this language server is currently not 100% stable, so bugs may
appear here and there.

## Getting Started

Language clients should usually install the language server for you
automatically, yet you can also install it manually. In this case, you have to
keep it up to date yourself, however.

You can download a binary from the [GitHub releases page][releases]. Checksums
are always attached so you can verify the integrity after download. Placing the
binary somewhere in your PATH means that language clients will be able to use it
without any additional steps.

## Usage

You can start the server in one of two modes:

- Standard I/O mode (by running `tsc-ls start`)
- TCP mode (by running `tsc-ls tcp`)

...however, you'd usually want a language client to handle this for you (a
plugin or configuration in your IDE/editor).

### Current Language Clients/Configurations

- Visual Studio Code (WIP)

## For Language Client Developers

The TSC language server exposes the following LSP-specific JSON-RPC methods:

- `textDocument/didOpen` - adds the opened document to the language server's
file handler
- `textDocument/didClose` - removes the document from the language server's file
handler
- `textDocument/didChange` - updates the document in the language server's file
handler and sends error/warning diagnostics to the client
- `textDocument/completion` - sends a list of TSC commands that can be used from
within the editor's autocompletion feature
- `textDocument/hover` - provides hover information for commands and events
- `tsc/setConfig` - updates the LSP's default configuration with overrides from
the workspace's `.tscrc.json` file
- `tsc/resetConfig` - reverts to the LSP's built-in (standard) TSC configuration
